# Accord

Ever feel like user experience in Discord was in... discord?

## Inspiration

I use a tiling window manager and hated the fact that, sometimes, my Discord
window would become too small to reasonably type. Then, I had an ephiphany.
If no one else would make a way to hide the sidebar, then why can't _I_ do
that? Taking things in my own hand and all that.

## Usage

### Vesktop

Copy the link to the raw stylesheet and paste it in the online themes
section.

**NOTE: You will need to enable the option 'Disable minimum window size' in Vesktop settings, otherwise this CSS sheet won't work!**

### Other clients

I haven't used them so idk how it works on them. Maybe sometime.

### Note

This stylesheet tints a channel to a slight red color to indicate that a ping
was sent from that. I did this because there was no real alternative to show a
ping on channels. Maybe this can change in the future, but for now, this is how
it is. As such, some themes might not play well with this script, or this
script might mess other themes up. Feel free to report any issues!
