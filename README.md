# Accord
Ever feel like using the app is smooth until it suddenly... discord? It's like 
the name was a warning all along!

## Inspiration
I use a tiling window manager and hated the fact that, sometimes, my Discord
window would become too small to reasonably type. Then, I had an ephiphany.
If no one else would make a way to hide the sidebar, then why can't *I* do
that? Taking things in my own hand and all that.

## Usage

### Vesktop
Copy the link to the raw stylesheet and paste it in the online themes
section.

### Other clients
I haven't used them so idk how it works on them. Maybe sometime.

### Note
This stylesheet tints a channel to a slight red color to indicate that a ping 
was sent from that. I did this because there was no real alternative to show a 
ping on channels. Maybe this can change in the future, but for now, this is how
it is. As such, some themes might not play well with this script, or this 
script might mess other themes up.

## Credits
I DIDN'T MAKE THIS SCRIPT ALL BY MYSELF

I'm not that smart. Here's the link to the original Gist with the CSS theme I
just touched up and stuff.
